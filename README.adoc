### Syndesis Verifier Service

This project offers the online verification of https://github.com/syndesisio/connectors[Camel Connectors]. It provides a single Endpoint

```
/api/v1/verifier
```

which take connector specific parameters as input and returns the result of the verification.

NOTE: Add detailed description of input and output parameters.


This service is called from within https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis-rest[Syndesis Rest] as part of its `/connectors/verifier` endpoint.

The data flow is:

```
Syndesis UI --> Syndesis Rest --> Syndesis Verifier --> Camel Connectors
```

It's meant to be used in a synchronous flow.


### Implementation Notes

In the initial version of this service the supported Camel Connectors (Twitter Mention, Salesforce Upsert, Http Get) are called directly from the same JVM in order to perform the validation. In a next step, these connectors are extracted into dedicated Pods which are managed and pooled and called from this Verifier Service on demand. More on this later ...
